# Monad Testnet Decentralize Map

## Network Decentralization Overview

> 🔧 **In Development** — Posthuman is building an interactive decentralization map for the Monad network.

### What's Coming

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🗺️ Global Node Map | Interactive map showing Monad node locations worldwide |
| 📊 Geographic Distribution | Breakdown by country, region, and data center |
| 🏢 Hosting Diversity | Analysis of hosting provider concentration |
| 📈 Nakamoto Coefficient | Real-time decentralization score |
| ⚖️ Stake Distribution | Validator stake concentration metrics |
| 🔄 Historical Trends | Track how decentralization evolves over time |

### Why It Matters

Decentralization is a core metric of network health. Concentration of nodes in a single geography or hosting provider creates single points of failure:

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Data center outage | Loss of significant network capacity |
| Regional regulation | Forced shutdown of concentrated nodes |
| Provider policy change | Mass node disconnection |
| Natural disaster | Geographic cluster goes offline |

### Preview

The Decentralize Map will include:

- **Live node count** — total active nodes and validators
- **Uptime heatmap** — node reliability scores by region
- **Peer connectivity graph** — visualize network topology
- **Alert zones** — highlight over-concentrated regions
